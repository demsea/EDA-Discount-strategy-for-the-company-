# EDA-Discount-strategy-for-the-company-Eniac
EDA and development of a new discount strategy for a fictitious company based on its historical data 

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a fictitious company Eniac's historical discount strategies to uncover patterns, trends, and their impact on sales performance. The main goal of this analysis was to determine whether discounting products is beneficial and, if so, to identify the optimal discount ranges for different product categories. More details and insights were presented in my presentation, where I analyzed specific discount strategies for each category.

### **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

Before conducting the analysis, I thoroughly cleaned the dataset by:

-   Removing corrupted and inconsistent rows
-   Deleting rows where insufficient data was available for meaningful analysis
-   Excluding orders that lacked corresponding information in other tables
-   Eliminating all duplicates
-   Filtering the dataset to include only completed orders for analysis

### **Tasks Accomplished**

1.  **Data Cleaning:** Removed inconsistencies, corrupted data, and duplicates. Analyzed only completed orders.
2.  **Trend Analysis:** Visualized discount patterns over time and their impact on sales.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** Examined the relationship between discount levels and key sales metrics.
4.  **Product Segmentation:** Identified groups of products by type, name and description
5.  **Profitability Assessment:** Evaluated which discount ranges maximize revenue for different product categories.
6.  **Actionable Recommendations:** Provided data-driven insights on optimization Eniacâ€™s future discounting strategies, tailored to seasonality, product categories, and product brand. 

This project aims to support data-driven decision-making for promotional strategies, helping Eniac enhance customer retention and maximize profitability
